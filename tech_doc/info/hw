 <p> To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Web Console in multi-line mode, and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(function(){<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"use strict";<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/* Start of your code */<br> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function greetMe(yourName) {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alert('Hello ' + yourName);<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;greetMe('World');<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;/* End of your code */<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;})();<br>
</p>

<p>Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> (or click the Run button) to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

<p>In the following pages, this guide introduces you to the JavaScript syntax and language features, so that you will be able to write more complex applications.</p>

<p>But for now, remember to always include the (function(){"use strict"; before your code, and add })(); to the end of your code. The strict mode and IIFE articles explain what those do, but for now they can be thought of as doing the following:</p>

<p>Prevent semantics in JavaScript that trip up beginners.</p>
<p>Prevent code snippets executed in the console from interacting with one-another (e.g., having something created in one console execution being used for a different console execution).</p>
